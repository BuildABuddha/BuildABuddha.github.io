title: Lambda School Projects & Assignments
subtitle: You can learn a lot in just a few months.
---

Lambda School is a program that teaches students a few different professions in the tech industry. I signed up for their Data Science curriculum. Here's what I learned while I was there.

## Projects

Every now and then, we get a project to work over the span of a week, rather than a daily assignment. They are either worked on individually or as a team. These are the real showcase pieces from my Lambda School education! I will usually try to write a short blog post to show my work when I'm finished.

[What Makes A Near-Earth Object Hazardous?](https://buildabuddha.github.io/2020-02-06-hazardous-neos/)

Using data exploration and visualization to show how organizations like NASA categorize near-earth objects as "potentially hazardous", and what this label actually means. 

## Daily Assignments

Every week, we get assigned around four assignments; one on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Here's a list of what I did while studying Data Science at Lambda School. Everything below here is not as important as the projects listed above, but still worth listing just to show what we went over.

#### Week 1: Data Wrangling and Storytelling
[Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/BuildABuddha/DS-Unit-1-Sprint-1-Data-Wrangling-and-Storytelling/blob/master/module1-exploratory-data-analysis/LS_DS_111_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Assignment.ipynb)

[Making Features](https://github.com/BuildABuddha/DS-Unit-1-Sprint-1-Data-Wrangling-and-Storytelling/blob/master/module2-make-features/LS_DS_112_Make_Features_Assignment.ipynb)

[Joining and Reshaping Data](https://github.com/BuildABuddha/DS-Unit-1-Sprint-1-Data-Wrangling-and-Storytelling/blob/master/module3-join-and-reshape-data/LS_DS_113_Join_and_Reshape_Data_Assignment.ipynb)

[Making Explanatory Visualizations](https://github.com/BuildABuddha/DS-Unit-1-Sprint-1-Data-Wrangling-and-Storytelling/blob/master/module4-make-explanatory-visualizations/LS_DS_114_Make_Explanatory_Visualizations_Assignment.ipynb)

#### Week 2: Statistics
