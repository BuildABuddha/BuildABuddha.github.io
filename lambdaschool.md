Lambda School is a program that teaches students a few different professions in the tech industry. I signed up for their Data Science curriculum. Here's what I learned while I was there.

### Projects


### Daily Assignments

Every week, we get assigned four assignments; one on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Here's a list of what I did while studying Data Science at Lambda School.

#### Week 1: Data Wrangling and Storytelling
[Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/BuildABuddha/DS-Unit-1-Sprint-1-Data-Wrangling-and-Storytelling/blob/master/module1-exploratory-data-analysis/LS_DS_111_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Assignment.ipynb)
[Making Features](https://github.com/BuildABuddha/DS-Unit-1-Sprint-1-Data-Wrangling-and-Storytelling/blob/master/module2-make-features/LS_DS_112_Make_Features_Assignment.ipynb)
[Joining and Reshaping Data](https://github.com/BuildABuddha/DS-Unit-1-Sprint-1-Data-Wrangling-and-Storytelling/blob/master/module3-join-and-reshape-data/LS_DS_113_Join_and_Reshape_Data_Assignment.ipynb)
