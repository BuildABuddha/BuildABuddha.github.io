title: About me
subtitle: Who is this guy, anyway?
---

My name is Lawrence Kimsey. I am currently a student at Lambda School, studying data science. Before that, I was an intern at NASA and a student at Boise State University, studying Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. I also do other fun side-projects, such as game modding, and the occasional commissioned coding job. 

If you're wondering whatâ€™s up with my GitHub handle, it's a funny nickname I picked up while playing Zenyatta, a character in the game Overwatch who is a robotic monk. I thought it fitting, considering my interests in both robotics and eastern philosophy/religion. 

### My History

After doing some basic classes at the College of Southern Nevada, I transferred over to Boise State University, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. At the time, I thought I hated programming and would enjoy myself in Mechanical Engineering. 

Turns out I was wrong. Not that I didn't enjoy mechanical engineering, but I found myself coming back to programming way more than the other gear-heads in my class. Eventually I decided to switch to Computer Science about three years into Mechanical Engineering. 

While I was a student at Boise State, I got tapped on the shoulder to do an internship with NASA at the Johnson Space Center, helping them figure out how to use consumer virtual reality equipment to train astronauts. That was easily the most exciting summer of my life.

Unfortunately, a combination of mental health and financial issues prevented me from finishing my degree. I'd probably have a degree by now if I had just picked Computer Science from the start... but oh well. Not all those who wander are lost, I guess?

I am currently using Lambda School's Data Science course to help prove that despite my lack of a finished degree, I'm still a worthy a worthy programmer. Might as well put those years of academia to use! 

### My Interests

As typical of those who end up in NASA, I'm very interested in the space industry, especially anything related to manned exploration. Robotics and AI are also very interesting to me, and I'd love to get the chance to do more in those fields. 

Like many millennials, I like to spend my spare time with video games. Some of my side projects are related to coding mods for games such as Stardew Valley. 

I'm a Secular Buddhist, although I try not to be weird about it. It does play a factor in my personal code of ethics, though. I don't follow any particular branch, but I do align a lot with the philosophies of Alan Watts.
