subtitle: Applying natural language processing tools for social media engagement analysis
---

In Lambda School, we are given a five-week long project to wprk on with other students. This is cross-discipline project, so data science students work with web dev students. 

In my case, I got assigned to the developmemt of a website called So-Me. The website is a social media management website, and were looking to incorporate more features into their Twitter account management service. 

After talking with my teammates, we came up with the idea of using natural language processing to analyze the post that your followers engage with the most. We thought this could be a potentially useful tool for those looking to increase engagement on Twitter.
